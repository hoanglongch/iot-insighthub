## Overview
This document provides troubleshooting procedures for common error scenarios encountered in the IoT InsightHub platform. For each error, the document details what went wrong, potential causes, and step-by-step mitigation and resolution instructions.

## 1. Database Connection Issues

**Error Description:**  
The secure API fails to connect to or insert data into the TimescaleDB. Typical error messages include "failed to initialize database" or timeouts when executing queries.

**Potential Causes:**  
- Incorrect DSN or misconfigured credentials.
- Network connectivity issues between the application and RDS.
- RDS instance is under heavy load or temporarily unavailable.
- Resource limits exceeded (e.g., connection pool size).

**Mitigation/Resolution Steps:**  
1. Inspect application logs to confirm the error message and locate the issue.
2. Verify DSN settings and credentials in both Terraform configuration and environment variables.
3. Use a network tool from within the VPC to test connectivity to the RDS endpoint.
4. Check CloudWatch metrics for the RDS instance and adjust instance size or connection pooling as necessary.
5. If the issue persists, escalate to the Database Operations team.

## 2. Failed Deployments

**Error Description:**  
New application deployments result in crashing pods, failed health checks, or incomplete rollouts.

**Potential Causes:**  
- Errors in the deployment manifests (wrong image tag, missing environment variables).
- Resource limits that are too low, causing pods to be terminated.
- Misconfigured readiness or liveness probes.
- Underlying infrastructure issues, such as problems with dependent services.

**Mitigation/Resolution Steps:**  
1. Use kubectl to describe affected pods and review logs:
   
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
   kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
2. If pods are crash-looping, restart the deployment:
   
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/<deployment-name> -n <namespace>
3. Rollback to the previous version:
   
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name> -n <namespace>
4. Update deployment manifests after identifying misconfigurations, then redeploy.
5. Escalate to the DevOps team for further investigation if the issue continues.

## 3. API Rate Limiting

**Error Description:**  
API requests are rejected with a "rate limit exceeded" message.

**Potential Causes:**  
- Sudden surge in traffic or misconfigured client behavior.
- Overly strict rate limiter settings in the authentication middleware.
- Possible DoS/DDoS attack or malfunctioning client code.

**Mitigation/Resolution Steps:**  
1. Review Prometheus metrics to analyze request rates.
2. Evaluate the rate limiting configuration in the middleware and adjust as necessary.
3. Identify if high traffic is expected or anomalous; if necessary, implement additional DDoS protection (e.g., AWS WAF, Shield).
4. If the issue persists, notify the security operations team and adjust scaling rules.

## 4. WASM Module Load/Execution Failures

**Error Description:**  
The client fails to load the WASM module or errors occur when calling WASM functions.

**Potential Causes:**  
- Network issues preventing the WASM file from being fetched.
- The server is not serving the WASM file with the correct MIME type (application/wasm).
- Runtime errors within the WASM module due to unhandled exceptions.
- Browser incompatibility issues.

**Mitigation/Resolution Steps:**  
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages related to WASM loading or execution.
2. Verify that the WASM file is hosted correctly and served with the proper MIME type.
3. Ensure that the fallback JavaScript implementation is in place and functioning.
4. Recompile the WASM module with TinyGo, observing for warnings or errors.
5. If problems remain, involve the front-end development team to debug and resolve issues.

## General Guidelines

- Always document every troubleshooting action for auditing.
- Review and update these procedures after each incident.
- Schedule regular post-incident analysis meetings to refine and improve error-handling practices.
- Ensure clear escalation paths are defined for each critical error scenario.
